# Bidding-System
In this, I have created a bidding system on the framework of an IPO (initial public offering), in which there are 5 stocks to be allocated and there are 300 people. At the 1st round, 1 stock shall be allocated to the 60 highest bidders, and each person shall bid for 3 or more stocks.
